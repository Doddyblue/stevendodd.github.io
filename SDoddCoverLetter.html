					<div class="box-info">
						<p>I work as an AtoN & Support Engineer with the Commissioners of Irish Lights (Irish Lights). I hold a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) degree. Currently, I am pursuing a Higher Diploma in Science in Computer Software Development through the National College of Ireland, with an anticipated graduation date in December 2025..<br>
							<br>
							Irish Lights serve as the lighthouse authority for the entire island of Ireland. Their responsibilities include overseeing coastal lights and navigation marks provided by local lighthouse authorities, county councils, and port authorities. They manage all lighthouses and other aids to navigation in Ireland (both North and South), as well as the adjacent seas and islands. Under the Merchant Shipping Act 1894, they are vested with the superintendence and management of these aids to navigation. Additionally, they fulfil the Irish Government’s obligations under the SOLAS Convention 1974 by providing marine aids to navigation (AtoN) in the Republic of Ireland. In Northern Ireland, they carry out the UK government’s SOLAS obligations for marine AtoN.<br>
							<br>
							In my role I manage Irish Lights MetOcean system, collaborating with external stakeholders such as the Met Eireann, OPW and the Marine Institute.  I support multiple communication channels and critical backend systems. <br>
							<br>
							During my employment at Irish Lights, I have enjoyed multiple roles and have been trained on many critical elements of Irish Lights Marine Aids to Navigation (AtoN). My training includes: Differential GPS (DGPS), Radar Beacons (Racon), and Automatic Identification Systems (AIS). I also explore the potential of AtoN infrastructure to maximise its benefits, including the use of e-Navigation components to deliver added-value content. I am currently involved with the testing of VDES (VHF Data Exchange System) and the IHO S-100 framework.<br>
							<br>
							I have worked with Irish Lights General Lighthouse Authority (GLA) partners Trinity House and the Northern Lighthouse Board, state agencies, and other stakeholders to achieve cost savings, operational flexibility, and innovation. <br>
							<br>
							I have been involved in multiple R&D project within Irish Lights while also collaborating with the Research and Development Directorate (GRAD), contributing to innovation and advancing our capabilities in the field of marine aids to navigation. This collaboration allows the GLA to explore cutting-edge technologies and enhance our services for safer navigation.
